# webgl-chain-maker
This project uses base WebGL to create a tool that can make many chain links that can be used to draw. This program implements a visual program with six distinctly colored "links." They're called links because they look like links of a chain. These links are base links that can be used to create copies. There is no more functionality to the base links other than to create copies.

## Controls
The copies can be dragged around the gray background.  
* By holding "SHIFT" and clicking a copy, it can be rotated clockwise by 45 degrees about its center.  
* By holding "CONTROL" and clicking a copy, it can be deleted.  
* The program is started by opening the html file in a browser.  
* Hitting "F5" in most browsers resets the canvas.
